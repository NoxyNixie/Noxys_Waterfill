  Noxys_Waterfill-enable-waterfill=This enables a standard water variant.
  Noxys_Waterfill-enable-deepwaterfill=This enables a deep water variant.
  Noxys_Waterfill-enable-waterfill-green=This enables the green water variant. This variant will always be green regardless of pollution levels.
  Noxys_Waterfill-enable-deepwaterfill-green=This enables the deep green water variant. This variant will always be green regardless of pollution levels.
  Noxys_Waterfill-enable-shallowwaterfill=This enables a shallow water variant.
  Noxys_Waterfill-enable-mudwaterfill=This enables a muddy water variant.
	Noxys_Waterfill-require-research=If this is enabled the recipes for waterfill will require research to be unlocked.
	Noxys_Waterfill-green-water-requires-uranium=When this is enabled the green water recipe will require Uranium-238 to craft.
	Noxys_Waterfill-recipe-difficulty=The difficulty of the crafting recipe and research.\n\nEasy: 1000 water\nNormal: 1000 water, 1 Explosives\nHard: 1000 water, 10 Explosives, 1 Processing unit.
	Noxys_Waterfill-waterfillable=Detirmines what entities can be destroyed by waterfill.\n\nNone: No entities of any kind.\nGenerated: Only naturally generated entities (except biter entities).\nGenerated & Biters: All generated entites including biters and their nests.\nEverything: No limits at all.
	Noxys_Waterfill-items-per-craft=How many items you will receive per crafting operation.
	Noxys_Waterfill-time-per-craft=How much time is needed per crafting operation (A larger number is a slower craft).
	Noxys_Waterfill-reach-increase-while-holding-waterfill=If enabled this will increase your reach distance while you are holding waterfill to make it a bit easier to place and a little bit less prone to killing you by placing it below you.
	Noxys_Waterfill-reach-with-waterfill=The amount of tiles the reach distance will be increased while holding waterfill.
	Noxys_Waterfill-water-per-deepwater=When this value is larger than 1 this setting will override the deep water recipe to require the specified amount of normal waterfill as ingredient.
